# guiLedController
The directory guiLedController contains the desktop application. 
I haven't ignored any files in that directory, so it can easily be build.<br/>
The directory avr is for the ATmega324PB.
It contains files for building the project with MPLAB IDE with the avr-gcc compiler.<br/>
For Arduino compatible boards, I also added an Arduino sketch in the arduino directory.
